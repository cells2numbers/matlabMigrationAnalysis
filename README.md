# matlabMigrationAnalysis
Matlab framework for extracting migration data out of microscopical video sequences showing living cells.

This repository bases on our validated cell tracking algorithm published in [1]. The matlabMigrationAnalysis implements a cell tracking scheme dedicated to migration analysis. 

## Requirements
MATLAB and the the Image Processing Library. For batch processing, the Parallel processing toolbox is usefull but not required. 

## Getting started 
1. clone the repository 
2. Start MATLAB and run the file `startMigrationAnalysisGui.m` 

A user guide can be found in the documentation folder.

## license 
MIT, see LICENSE file.
